					<h1>GENERAL RULES</h1>

						<li><h2>DON'T BE A DICK</h2>

								</li>
								<li>Don't pull a lame move in game. For instance, if you are cornered by zombies, don't suddenly remove your bandanna and claim to be out-of-play. That is just so lame.</li>
								<li>Players are obligated to keep the campus clean. Pick up stray darts, bandanas, blasters, and socks left outside, and make your upmost effort to return them to their owners, or to a moderator (who will return them to the owner).
								</li>
							</ul><br/>
						</li>

						<li><h2>All players must register online through the HvZ Source.</h2>

								<li>Don't let the game stop you from doing what you need to do.</li>
								<li>If you are having a rough day and can't handle the game, it is okay to remove your bandana and stop playing for a little while. (If you are zombie you should be wary of [starving out!])</li>
							</ul><br/>
						</li>
						
						<li><h2>Be safe and use common sense.</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Avoid playing in parking lots or streets.</li>
								<li>Don't damage campus property, or the personal property of others.</li>

					<h1>HUMAN RULES</h1><br/>
					<ol class="rules_list">
						<li><h2>Defend yourselves with the following methods:</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Socks: must be balled-up or tied-up socks.  These can be thrown at Zombies.  In order for a sock to stun a Zombie, it must leave the Human's hand; it cannot be used as a glove/worn on the body, or used as a melee weapon.  However, Humans can throw as many socks as they want to at the same time.</li>
								<li>Foam projectile blasters: these include Nerf and other similar air- and spring-powered blasters.  Projectiles must be made primarily of foam.  Players may modify their blasters, but the modifications may not cause pain or injury to others (moderators can and will test modified blasters).  Players may also paint their blasters, however they must only use bright, fluorescent colors that will be visible at night.  Blasters must not be painted to look like real guns.  Full coats of black and/or silver are not allowed.  All blasters must have orange tips.  Players may only use blasters to fire foam projectiles; players who use blasters to hit others will be banned from the game. Blasters are now allowed at any time of the day or night.  Foam projectiles may never be thrown.</li>
								<li>Foam projectile blowpipes:  a type of blaster that is commonly home-made with pipe (usually PVC).  The length of a blowpipe may not exceed three feet.  Players are encouraged to paint or tape an orange tip on their blowpipes.</li>
								<li>NOTE: If a sock/foam projectile ricochets off of the ground, a wall, a tree, a lamppost, or any other obstacle before hitting a Zombie, the Zombie is not stunned.</li>
								<li>NOTE 2: Humans are encouraged to label their socks, blasters, and foam projectiles with their name or another uniform and recognizable mark.</li>
							</ul><br/>
						</li>
						
						<li><h2>Be safe!</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Foam projectiles (darts) may NEVER be modified.</li>
								<li>Socks cannot be modified by filling them with rocks, sand, dirt, or other weighted objects.  Filling them with other socks is acceptable.</li>
								<li>Humans may not fire projectiles/throw socks at other players or non-players inappropriately, or with the intention of causing harm.</li>
								<li>Do not point blasters at non-players, or hold blasters in a threatening manner.</li>
								<li>No headshots! Any projectiles/socks that connect with a Zombie's head and neck are invalid, and the Zombie remains un-stunned.</li>
								<li>No melee allowed (this includes foam swords, axes, staffs, etc.)</li>
							</ul><br/>
						</li>
					</ol>

				<div id="zombie_column">
					<h1>ZOMBIE RULES</h1><br/>
					<ol class="rules_list">
						<li><h2>The Original Zombie:</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>The OZ(s) are selected and privately contacted by moderators at the start of the game.  They must wear their bandannas on their arms, like Humans.  They are also allowed to carry blasters and socks.  These rules are only in effect on the first day of play, and are not in effect after the OZ makes a certain number of kills.  Moderators will announce the number of kills at the beginning of each game.  After the time limit is up or the amount of kills has been met, OZs must wear their bandanna on their head.</li>
								<li>If the OZ is asked about his or her status in the game (i.e.- "Are you the OZ?"), he or she does not have to answer truthfully.  If other Zombies are asked whether or not they are still Human, they may answer truthfully, divert the question, or not answer at all.  Nobody can lie, except the OZ.</li>
							</ul><br/>
						</li>
						
						<li><h2>Tagging:</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>In order to make a valid tag, both hands must be in contact with the Human.</li>
								<li>When tagged, a Human must become a Zombie.</li>
								<li>Upon tagging a Human, Zombies must collect the Human's ID number. They must then log the number into HvZ Source. This counts as one tag.</li> 
								<li>If a group of Zombies help one Zombie tag a Human, this can count as a shared tag. The Zombie who makes the tag can share it with up to two other players who were present at the time of the tagging.</li> 
								<li>Tags are logged in military time.  If a Zombie tags a Human at 3:00 PM, the tag should be logged as having occurred at 15:00.</li> 
								<li>If a Zombie does not tag a Human (or assist in the tagging of a Human) within 48 hours, he or she has starved out.  Those who starve out may not continue playing.</li>
								<li>Any tags dealt to the head or neck are invalid.</li>
								<li>Any tags dealt to a Human's blaster is invalid.</li>
								<li>Tags dealt to accessories such as bags or clothing are valid.</li>
							</ul><br/>
						</li>
						
						<li><h2>Getting stunned:</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Any foam projectiles or socks that come into contact with a Zombie's accessories (such as clothing, bags, etc.) count as stuns.</li>
								<li>When Zombies are hit with foam projectiles/socks, they must move their bandannas from their heads to their necks until their stun time is complete.</li>
								<li>Stun time lasts for fifteen minutes during normal game play.</li>
								<li>When stunned, Zombies cannot follow Humans or continue play with other Zombies until their stun time is complete. </li>
								<li>If a Zombie is stunned again before his stun time is complete, his or her stun time is reset to fifteen minutes.</li>
							</ul><br/>
						</li>
						
						<li><h2>Be safe!</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Zombies may not tag other players inappropriately.  They may only use their hands to make tags.</li>
								<li>Zombies are not allowed to bring Humans outside of safe zones by force.</li>
								<li>Zombies may not use non-players as shields.</li>
							</ul><br/>
						</li>
					</ol>	
				</div><!-- zombie_column -->
					
				<div class="clearfix"></div>
					
					<h1>MISSION RULES</h1><br/>
						<ul>
							<li>Missions are an incredible part of New Paltz HvZ.  They bring players together through exciting events.  During missions, moderators may call for rules that are not the same as the general rules of the game.</li>
							<li>Before missions, moderators will announce meeting times and places for Humans and Zombies.</li>
							<li>Stun timers may be changed, or even omitted and replaced with spawn points (areas where stunned Zombies must go in order to become un-stunned).</li>
							<li>Although missions may be fast-paced, Zombies must remember to collect the ID numbers of the Humans they tag.</li>
							<li>Players are not allowed to enter buildings during missions unless otherwise stated.</li>
							<li>Attending missions adds dimension to the game and makes it a lot more fun.</li>
							<li>As always, have respect for other players, non-players, and NPCs (neutral moderators).</li>
						</ul><br/>

					<h1>DISPUTES</h1><br/>
						<h2>In the event of the legality of a tag or a stun is unclear, disputes can be settled simply by:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Flipping a coin</li>
							<li>Playing rock-paper-scissors</li>
							<li>Thunderdome:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Usually used when Zombies cannot tell who tagged a Human first and no agreement can be made.</li>
								<li>All parties, both Zombie and Human, must consent.</li>
								<li>Involved parties find an open space and form a circle: Zombies on the outside, Humans on the inside.</li>
								<li>Humans are allowed to use only as many foam projectiles/socks as there are Zombies (if there are five Zombies and two Humans, they must share five projectiles/socks).</li>
								<li>At an agreed time, the Zombies rush the Humans.  If the Humans can escape, they win.  If they do not, the Zombies divide the tags amongst themselves.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul><br/>

					<h1>DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS</h1><br/>
						<h2>There are three strikes in the disciplinary system:</h2>
						<ul>
							<h3>Verbal Warning:</h3>
							<li>Officers and moderators can issue verbal warnings directed at a player who has performed the following infractions:</li>
							<li>Minor violent action not directed at any other person.</li>
							<li>Disrespect directed at anyone in and around the game.</li>
							<li>Repeated disregard of the organization's rules.</li>
							<li><h3>Yellow Card:</h3></li>
							<ul>
								<li>A formal warning issued by an officer or moderator, directed at a member who has performed the following infractions after a verbal warning has been issued:</li>
									<li>Failure to comply with verbal warnings.</li>
									<li>Repeated disrespect of officers, moderators, and others in and around the game</li>
									<li>They can also be issued for any issue that deems more than a verbal warning but not sufficient for removal from the game.</li>			
								<li>Players issued a yellow card must have a sit-down talk with moderator(s) present at the giving of the card, and the safety officer, vice president, and/or president.</li>
							</ul>
							<li><h3>Red Card:</h3></li> 
							<ul>
								<li>A red card is a severe penalty that can result from the following:</li>
								<li>A player has earned more than one yellow card.</li>
								<li>A player has committed a serious offence, such as:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Violent action toward another living being.</li>
										<li>Disrespect or mistreatment of campus police, administration, or faculty.</li>
										<li>Any other severe action deemed necessary for removal from the game.</li>
									</ul>	
								<li>Players issued a red card are suspended from the current game and must meet with the officers and involved moderator(s) before reinstatement. The officers must follow voting procedure to allow the player in question back into the game.</li>
