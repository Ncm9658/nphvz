              <div class="about_header">Our <span class="accent_color">History</span></div>

              <div>Humans Vs. Zombies was first brought to SUNY New Paltz as a program in Lefevre Hall by Kenji Konishiro. As the game gained popularity, it expanded into a campus wide event and was approved as a club starting in 2010, thanks to the efforts of Dexter Pabulayan and Nicholas Andersen. Soon the E-Board ballooned and grew to include a separate board of moderators to referee the game. What had once been a small game amongst friends became one of the largest clubs on the campus, hosting nearly 150 players a semester.</div>

              <div>With that in mind, we as a club have decided to shed the weight of the HvZ Source, forming our own website and game tracker. Our hope with this is to allow for a more personal experience that caters to the needs of the SUNY New Paltz Humans vs. Zombies community. Here you can find a full list of our E-Board, as well as contact information for them.</div>

              <div>We hope to make this game a wonderful experience for all, and can't wait to see you out in the field of battle! </div>
